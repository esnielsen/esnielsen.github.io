[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Designing Marine Protected Areas, or MPAS, can be difficult, and we still have a lot to learn - as beautifully portrayed in the comic above by Anju Sabu.\nThere are complex and dynamic social-ecological systems that need to be weighed and balanced to create an arrangement of MPAs that best protect the natural environment, and provide for various cultural and economic uses of marine resources.\nBut, we have come a long way in understanding how to best create this balance, often using spatial planning concepts, which this video by Jennifer McGowan does a superb job at explaining:\n  However, as scientists, we often like to take simple concepts like targeting representation in MPAs, and make it more complex.\nThis is described in an Epistle by the conservation planning guru Prof Hugh Possingham:\n__\n\u0026ldquo;The Lame-duck Conservation Principle\nRemember the good old days when conservation planning was just two main principles – adequacy and representation? It seems so simple and logical. But at some point we lost sight of the importance of representation, the simple notion of protecting a sample of everything in a well-managed protected area. What happened?\nIn theory, representation is still at the top of the international conservation agenda, it gets a solid mention in Aichi Target 11, which states:\n\u0026lsquo;By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape.\u0026rsquo;\nThe Nature Conservancy has championed the cause of representation, with representation and resilience forming the core principles of our new protect land and water strategy. But the rest of the world seems to have lost interest.\nIn my simple mind, The Nature Conservancy is the \u0026lsquo;habitat organisation.\u0026rsquo; That is why I joined. We focus on how to make more quality habitat, in all its forms, because it delivers benefits for people and nature. So it is only logical that we always return to a strong focus on habitat representation.\nYet while we continue to keep our eye on the ball, some organisations and groups believe that a focus on threatened species, via Key Biodiversity Areas, is the best way to prioritisation protection. Others are pushing connectivity as the most important conservation principle — let’s connect the Yukon to Yellowstone. I agree that both are important, but still very much secondary to the notion of protecting a representative sample of habitats or ecosystems.\nWhy are we losing this marketing campaign? In my opinion, representation is on the backburner because it is intellectually a little dull. Connectivity captures the imagination of many scientists, it can be measured by 100 different metrics, while ideas like \u0026lsquo;corridors\u0026rsquo; seem to capture the hearts and minds of the public and politicians. I love connectivity, but I am convinced it is a secondary issue. And, of course, threatened species are all so sexy — with their big brown eyes— much sexier than a place like the mallee woodland (my favourite habitat in Australia).\nSo here’s my challenge to you: Representation is the most boring but important concept in conservation. So how to we make it sexy again?\u0026rdquo;\n__\nI have been thinking of Prof Possingham\u0026rsquo;s question of how do we make the simple act of targeting representation sexy - and I think the answer comes down to making representation a surrogate for adaptability.\nI would argue that nothing is sexier in conservation science at the moment than prioritising areas that are more resilient to climate change. My work specifically looks at areas that are more genetically diverse, and thus assumed to be more resilient to environmental change. And interestingly, there have been several recent publications that suggest that by representing different habitat types (or different species distributions), you are also capturing genetic diversity.\nYou can find such papers in the links below:\n Geographical surrogates of genetic variation for selecting island populations for conservation\n Environmental and geographic variables are effective surrogates for genetic variation in conservation planning\n Incorporating evolutionary processes into conservation planning using species distribution data: a case study with the western Mediterranean herpetofauna: Evolutionary processes in conservation planning\n Testing large-scale conservation corridors designed for patterns and processes: comparative phylogeography of three tree species\n  But of course, this is science, so here is this paper arguing the opposite:\n On the validity of habitat as a predictor of genetic structure in aquatic systems: a comparative study using California water beetles  I think the argument of representative habitats as surrogates of species and genetic diversity could help bring this elegant practice back in the forefront of conservation planning, but I think it will also require scientists to change our perspective of our work, as to not think about how well our work will publish, but how well it can be applied to \u0026lsquo;real-world\u0026rsquo; conservation practice.\nSo really we need a whole paradigm shift within Academia\u0026hellip; but for now let\u0026rsquo;s just settle with a haiku about representation in conservation planning:\n~\nMPA designs,\nTo make easier target:\nRepresentation\n~\nThanks for reading!\n","date":1536330774,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536330774,"objectID":"6948b51fb1cb263b4b2ffc9ed99fb28b","permalink":"/project/respresentation/","publishdate":"2018-09-07T16:32:54+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/respresentation/","section":"project","summary":"A case for habitat representation in 21st century conservation planning","tags":null,"title":"Representation: The foundation of conservation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have always loved Cindi Lauper\u0026rsquo;s style and her iconic song, \u0026lsquo;Girls just want to have fun\u0026rsquo;, and when I saw this photo (see above) from the Women\u0026rsquo;s March, I knew I needed to make my own rendition of the song.

However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.","tags":[],"title":"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Yet, there is no clear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despite multiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patterns differ between species, but the potential trade-offs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservation planning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metrics of genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypes and local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes ofconservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitat representation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representation than on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similar conservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diverse array of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital to creating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns.","tags":[],"title":"Multispecies genetic objectives in spatial conservation planning","type":"publication"}]
