The sync file can also be converted into a genepop file for further analysis.\nNotes of Popoolation/Polpoolation2:\nThere is not much guidance on these programs available online. Plus, the sync2GenePop conversion step requires custom scripts to be written so that it can be run on all loci at once, instead of each locus individually. Feel free to contact me if you wish to see perl scripts used to create a GenePop file for an entire pool.\nFreeBayes -\ninput: BAM files \u0026amp; a reference fasta file\noutput: a pool VCF file\nCRISP -\ninput: bam files, pool sample sizes, reference fasta file (NB: requires at least 2 pools/2 bam files)\noutput: a pool VCF file\nSNVer -\ninput: a batch of bam files (one per pool) \u0026amp; a text file with the bam file names, number of haploids, number of samples, and filtering thresholds\noutput: a pool VCF file\nNotes on FreeBayes, CRISP \u0026amp; SNVer:\nEven though these programs make VCF files, I personally could not find a way to convert these VCF files to other inputs such as genepop/genind/genlight to in conversion tools such as PGDspider, vcf2genepop, or genomic_converter. However, it seems like it can be input into the R package poolfstat to calculate F-statistics, and be converted into files for BayPass and SelEstim.\nSNAPE-pool -\ninput: single pool pileup files (not mpileup files)\noutput: allele frequency output files\nnpstat -\ninput: mpileup (all pools combined) + individual bam files (per pool) Can also take GFF3 annotations to perform McDonald-Krietman tests.\noutput: population specific diversity indices (such at Tajima\u0026rsquo;s pi \u0026amp; D, Watterson\u0026rsquo;s theta), and population differentiation (FSTs)\nSNPgenie -\ninput: a vcf file (for a single pool), a reference fasta file, and gtf annotation file\noutput: πN/πS, dN/dS, and other evolutionary parameters (has a great number output files)\nNote: This program is only for model species with annotated genomes.\nPCAdapt -\ninput: a frequency matrix with n rows and L columns (where n is the number of populations and L is the number of genetic markers)\noutput: several plots and list of potential outlier loci\nNote: For my data, this program suggested quite a large number of putative outliers, especially compared to Bayescan, Loistan, and Popoolation FSTs.\nSelEstim -\ninput: allele/read count file\nouput: a \u0026lsquo;delta\u0026rsquo; output file which is input in R to find outlier loci\nNote: I personally tried SelEstim with ~ 8,000 loci, and the program ran for about 4 weeks without finishing, so could not use due to time restraints.\nPool-hmm -\ninput: samtools mpileup (Note: the mpileup command should not have -u or -g option)\noutput: allele frequency spectrum, plus probability of \u0026ldquo;Neutral\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Intermediate\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Selection\u0026rdquo; for each polymorphic site, with additional stats files\n~\nAdditionally, here is a short list of some pipelines available for Pool-seq \u0026amp; non-model organisms:\nPool-party\ndDocent\nGATK\nSTACKS\nAlso, for complete bioinformatics beginners, Galaxy is a great way to understand various bioinformatic programs and their command lines.\n~\nHappy analysing!\n","date":1536278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536278400,"objectID":"c9ed5ef0a89702b1212cbd56345a94ab","permalink":"https://esnielsen.github.io/post/a-guide-to-ngs-pool-seq-programs/","publishdate":"2018-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/a-guide-to-ngs-pool-seq-programs/","section":"post","summary":"As Pooled sequencing gains popularity in the world of genomics, more and more programs are being introduced to specifically handle Pool-seq data.

However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.","tags":[],"title":"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Yet, there is noclear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despitemultiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patternsdiffer between species, but the potential tradeoffs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservationplanning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metricsof genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypesand local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes ofconservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitatrepresentation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representationthan on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similarconservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diversearray of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital tocreating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns.","tags":[],"title":"Multispecies genetic objectives in spatial conservation planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461708000,"objectID":"553a94c5dfd3b8b099d8a12b2d248093","permalink":"https://esnielsen.github.io/project/example-external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/example-external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
