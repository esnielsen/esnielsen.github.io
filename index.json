The sensitivity of marine species to climate change is increasingly being described with forecasted species distributions, yet these rarely account for population level processes such as genomic variation and local adaptation. This study compares inter-and intraspecific patterns of biological composition to determine how vulnerability to climate change, and its environmental drivers, vary across species and populations. We compare species trajectories for three ecologically important southern African marine invertebrates at two time points in the future, both at the species level, with correlative species distribution models, and at the population level, with gradient forest models. Reported range shifts are species-specific and include both predicted range gains and losses. Forecasted species responses to climate change are strongly influenced by changes in a suite of environmental variables, from sea surface salinity and sea surface temperature, to minimum air temperature. Our results further suggest a mismatch between future habitat suitability (where species can remain in their ecological niche) and genomic vulnerability (where populations retain their genomic composition), highlighting the inter-and intraspecific variability in species’ sensitivity to global change. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of considering species and population level climatic vulnerability when proactively managing coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene.","tags":[],"title":"Distinct interspecific and intraspecific vulnerability of coastal species to global change","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Population structure \u0026amp; outlier detection for Pool-seq data This tutorial will discuss how to call SNPs and assess population structure from Pool-Seq data.

If the subsample size is \u0026lt;0, then all SNPs are included in the BayPass files. pooldata2genobaypass(SG.pooldata, writing.dir = getwd(), subsamplesize = -1) From here, you may want to filter the SNP dataset to account for linkage disequilibrium. If so, you can use this custom script that randomly selects one SNP per every 1000 base pairs along each contig:\n################################# LD PRUNING ############################### ################################################################################## # To run the script below, you need to take the snpdet output from the poolfstat2baypass command above, and give the columns headers.

To do this, we first need to combine the .genobaypass and .snpdet outptut files from above. So in excel or text editor, have the first columns relate to the .snpdet output, then add the .genobaypass columns following. In other words, your input file here is the contig position, allele states, and then allele counts. Make sure the columns do not have headers. Here I called this file \u0026#39;SG.snpdet.geno.txt\u0026#39; library(dplyr) # Read the .genobaypass/.snpdet file type explained above, relating to all SNPs snp.data\u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026quot;SG.snpdet.geno.txt\u0026quot;,sep=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,header=F) # Read your LD SNP list. To make this text file, I just took the first two columns of the SG.LD.list excel file just created, and turned that into a text file. So basically a text file with first column being contig, and second column being position for all LD-pruned SNPs (but with no column headers) ld.data\u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026quot;SG.LD.index.txt\u0026quot;,sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;,header=F) # Filter the list of all SNPs to now only list the LD pruned SNPs snp.data.f \u0026lt;- dplyr::inner_join(snp.data, ld.data) # Write out as new file, and then from there you can split back up into new .snpdet and .genobaypass input files write.table(snp.data.f, file=\u0026quot;SG.LD.snpdet.geno.txt\u0026quot;, col.names = F, row.names= F, quote = F) Now we are ready to input our LD-pruned BayPass files into BayPass. Here we will use a combination of bash and R scripts to run through BayPass analyses. I will briefly show the main commands used in the bash scripts, and explain how they are used in combination with the R scripts.\nThe first step is to make sure you have compiled BayPass and have it with all of your input files in your working directory (not in R directory but Terminal type of program). Then you need to understand which of the model types you want to run. The standard core model is used to asses population structure, and identify outlier SNPs using a ‘FST type approach’. Alternatively, the auxiliary covariate model can be used to identify outlier SNPs using a ‘GEA type approach’, similar to BayEnv. Here we will just use the core model. The bash script will look something like this:\ng_baypass -npop 14 -gfile SG.genobaypass -poolsizefile SG.poolsize -d0yij 8 -outprefix SG.BP -npilot 100\nHere’s some parameter explanations:\n-npop = number of pools\n-gfile \u0026amp; -poolsizefiles are relating to your input file names\n-d0yij = is something to do with the initial read counts and their distribution seeded into the model, and is specifically for Pool-seq data. I followed the tip in the manual that says to set it to 1/5th of the minimum pool size\n-outprefix = the header of the output files\n-npilot = number of pilot runs\nSo after you run the above, you should then get a number of output files. What we will need for the next part in R, is the following: ’_mat_omega.out’, ’_summary_beta_params.out’, ’_summary_pi_xtx.out’. You also need to make sure you have the ‘baypass_utils.R’ R code that comes with the program, as we will be running some of these scripts now.\nNow we will go into R, to both visualize the results, but also to create the pseudo observation dataset (POD), which will be used to identify outlier SNPs.\n################################# BAYPASS CREATE POD ############################### ################################################################################## source(\u0026quot;baypass_utils.R\u0026quot;) require(corrplot) ; require(ape) library(WriteXLS) # Read omega matrix BayPass output SG.omega=as.matrix(read.table(\u0026quot;SG.BP_mat_omega.out\u0026quot;)) # Identify pool names for plotting colnames(SG.omega) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;PN\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;HB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;BB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;LB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;JB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;SP\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;BT\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;CA\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;MB\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;KY\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;CF\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;PA\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;HH\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;HL\u0026quot;) rownames(SG.omega) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;PN\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;HB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;BB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;LB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;JB\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;SP\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;BT\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;CA\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;MB\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;KY\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;CF\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;PA\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;HH\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;HL\u0026quot;) # Create a correlation matrix of the omega values, which can be used to assess genomic differentiation between pools cor.mat=cov2cor(SG.omega) corrplot(cor.mat,method=\u0026quot;color\u0026quot;,mar=c(2,1,2,2)+0.1, main=expression(\u0026quot;Correlation map based on\u0026quot;~hat(Omega))) # We can also assess population differentiation with hierarchical clustering: bta14.tree=as.phylo(hclust(as.dist(1-cor.mat**2))) plot(bta14.tree,type=\u0026quot;p\u0026quot;, main=expression(\u0026quot;Hier. clust. tree based on\u0026quot;~hat(Omega)~\u0026quot;(\u0026quot;*d[ij]*\u0026quot;=1-\u0026quot;*rho[ij]*\u0026quot;)\u0026quot;)) # Read the xtx BayPass output SG.snp.res=read.table(\u0026quot;SG.BP_summary_pi_xtx.out\u0026quot;,h=T) # Get the Pi Beta distribution for POD generation SG.pi.beta.coef=read.table(\u0026quot;SG.BP_summary_beta_params.out\u0026quot;,h=T)$Mean # Upload original data to get read counts SG.data\u0026lt;-geno2YN(\u0026quot;SG.genobaypass\u0026quot;) # Simulate POD dataset to use for outlier SNP detection simu.SG \u0026lt;-simulate.baypass(omega.mat=SG.omega,nsnp=10000,sample.size=SG.data$NN, beta.pi=SG.pi.beta.coef,pi.maf=0,suffix=\u0026quot;SG.BP.sim\u0026quot;) ## 1000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 2000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 3000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 4000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 5000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 6000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 7000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 8000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 9000 SNP simulated out of 10000 ## 10000 SNP simulated out of 10000 The above R script will give you new BayPass input files with the suffix of ‘SG.BP.sim’.

And even though we are currently in a pandemic worth talking about, I still find myself wanting to talk about COVID-19 and the chaos it has created in relation to the climate crisis.\nThat being said, I rarely find myself actually having climate conversations. And it seems like I am not alone. Only 19% of Americans discuss the climate crisis least once a month. After seeing this, I asked myself \u0026ldquo;WHY?\u0026rdquo;. Then, I answered myself (I talk to myself a lot), \u0026ldquo;Because it\u0026rsquo;s not like I can just bring it up easily.\u0026rdquo;\nWe often think talking about the climate crisis has to be in a formal, direct, and emotionally heated manner. But it can start with a simple question.

Do you think natural disasters are getting worse?\nWhat do you think the benefits/dangers of current technology are? Do you think technology is helping or hurting our relationship with nature?\nIf you could make any change to the Earth, what would it be?\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem we will face in the future? What do you think is the biggest problem we have faced in the past?\nHow far do you think the influences of your actions go?\nHave you ever experienced fake news? What was it? How did you find out?\nWhat are your hopes for your children?\nWhat do you value most about nature?\nWhat would you say your privileges are? How can you use them to help those that are under-privileged?\nWhen was the last time you were influenced by something/someone?\nWhere do you get your information about the world?\nWhat do you want your legacy to be?\nWhat is your relationship with food?\nWhat kind of traditions do you practice, and what role do they play in your life? Do you think traditions should adapt with new generations?\nWhat freedoms are you thankful for?\nQuestions once on the topic of climate change:\nDo you think humans have a moral responsibility to protect other living things?\nHow do you think we ended up in this climate crisis? What actions do you think led us here and why?\nWhat is your relationship with nature/the climate? How do you think that relationship will look like in the future?\nWhat are the things you think humanity is doing right?\nDo you think we as humans are part of ecosystems? Or are we in control of them?\nWhat is something you want to learn more about with regards to nature/climate?\nWhat emotions come up when you think about our history/future on Earth?\nWhat are some changes you want to make but are struggling to? What do you think are the biggest roadblocks to creating change?\nDo you worry about climate change? Why/why not? Why do you think some people may think the opposite?\nDo you feel guilty about doing anything which is bad for the environment? Have others made you feel guilty? Do you think you have made others feel guilty?\nWhat actions should we take for a better future / to re-create how things were in the past?\nWhat systems need to change the most to tackle the climate crisis?\nWhat do you think your individual role is in taking action against the climate crisis? What sacrifices would you need to make to fulfill this role?\nWhat are some changes you\u0026rsquo;ve seen in your hometown with regards to the climate? Has it affected your life?

In this example we will use models to estimate the probability of occurence at two timepoints: present day and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). You can do the same with more time points, into the past and/or future.\nWe will obtain the predictor environmental variables from Bio-Oracle with the R package sdmpredictors. Since I work on intertidal species, I want to include both terrestrial and marine environmental variables. We will first load and stack the layers.\nIt is also important to only include variables that are available at both time points you want to model.\nlibrary(sdmpredictors) # Download present day environmental variables #+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ #download terrestrial features (Temp_max, Temp_min, Temp_range) terr \u0026lt;- load_layers( layercodes = c(\u0026quot;WC_bio5\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;WC_bio6\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;WC_bio7\u0026quot;) , equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE) #download marine features mar \u0026lt;- load_layers( layercodes = c(\u0026quot;MS_biogeo08_sss_mean_5m\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MS_biogeo13_sst_mean_5m\u0026quot;) , equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE) #check the chacteristics of each raster stack terr ## class : RasterStack ## dimensions : 1800, 4320, 7776000, 3 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -60, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 ## names : WC_bio5, WC_bio6, WC_bio7 ## min values : -7.3, -55.5, 5.3 ## max values : 48.9, 25.8, 72.5 mar ## class : RasterStack ## dimensions : 2160, 4320, 9331200, 2 (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers) ## resolution : 0.08333333, 0.08333333 (x, y) ## extent : -180, 180, -90, 90 (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) ## crs : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 ## names : MS_biogeo08_sss_mean_5m, MS_biogeo13_sst_mean_5m ## min values : -0.05, -2.00 ## max values : 40.43, 30.40 Notice how the two raster stacks have different dimensions.

Now we have a single raster stack called ‘env’. We now need to remove highly correlated environmental variables.\nHere we will need to include our species presence data, which should include three columns: columns 1 \u0026amp; 2: x and y coordinates; column 3: presence (1) or absence (0) at each coordinate.\nTo check for variable collinearity, we will first extract the environmental data for each coordinate, create a correlation circle, and then calculate the variance inflation factor, or VIF.\n# Filter environmental variables to account for collinearity #+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ # Import your presence data and plot pres.data \u0026lt;-read.table(\u0026quot;Cpunctatus.pres2.txt\u0026quot;,sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;,header=T) plot(env.c$WC_bio5) points(pres.data[,1:2], pch=19, col=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;) # Extract env values for our species locations: envdata \u0026lt;- extract(x=env.c, y=cbind(pres.data$x, pres.data$y)) # Run PCA and plot correlation circle # The `dudi.pca` function allows us to perform the PCA over the whole study area.

However, it is also important to know which environmental features are more relevant to your study species, and to choose according to the ecology of each species. # A note on arrow directions: same direction = highly correlated, orthogonal (this means at a 90 degree angle) = unrelated, opposite directions = negatively correlated # From the plot, we can get rid of variable WC_bio6, and plot again.

The environmental features from Bio-Oracle automatically include the lowered sea levels at the LGM which is nice.\nIt is generally good practice to include multiple climatic models. Here we will include two models: CCSM4 and MIROC. The oceanic layers are already an ensemble of multiple models, so we will use the ensemble without CCSM with the MIROC terrestrial layer, and the ocean model including CCSM with the CCSM terrestrial layer.\n# Download historical environmental data #+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ # Load layers and make sure they are in the same order as your contemporary raster stack (WC_bio5, WC_bio7, SSS, SST) a.miroc.21 \u0026lt;- load_layers(layercodes = c(\u0026quot;WC_bio7_cclgm\u0026quot;), equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE, datadir=NULL) a.ccsm.21 \u0026lt;- load_layers(layercodes = c(\u0026quot;WC_bio7_mrlgm\u0026quot;), equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE, datadir=NULL) o.ens.adj.21 \u0026lt;- load_layers(layercodes = c(\u0026quot;MS_biogeo08_sss_mean_21kya_adjCCSM\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MS_biogeo13_sst_mean_21kya_adjCCSM\u0026quot;), equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE, datadir=NULL) o.ens.nc.21 \u0026lt;- load_layers(layercodes = c(\u0026quot;MS_biogeo08_sss_mean_21kya_noCCSM\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MS_biogeo13_sst_mean_21kya_noCCSM\u0026quot;), equalarea=FALSE, rasterstack=TRUE, datadir=NULL) a.miroc.21.2 \u0026lt;-resample(a.miroc.21, s2, method=\u0026quot;ngb\u0026quot;) a.ccsm.21.2 \u0026lt;-resample(a.ccsm.21, s2, method=\u0026quot;ngb\u0026quot;) o.ens.adj.21.2 \u0026lt;-resample(o.ens.adj.21, s2, method=\u0026quot;ngb\u0026quot;) o.ens.nc.21.2 \u0026lt;-resample(o.ens.nc.21, s2, method=\u0026quot;ngb\u0026quot;) miroc.21 =stack(a.miroc.21.2, o.ens.nc.21.2 ) ccsm.21 =stack(a.ccsm.21.2, o.ens.adj.21.2 ) miroc.21.crop \u0026lt;- crop(miroc.21, SA.ext) ccsm.21.crop \u0026lt;- crop(ccsm.21, SA.ext) miroc.21.c \u0026lt;- stack(miroc.21.crop) ccsm.21.c \u0026lt;- stack(ccsm.21.crop) writeRaster(miroc.21.c, filename=\u0026quot;miroc.21.tif\u0026quot;, format=\u0026quot;GTiff\u0026quot;, overwrite=TRUE) writeRaster(ccsm.21.c, filename=\u0026quot;ccsm.21.tif\u0026quot;, format=\u0026quot;GTiff\u0026quot;, overwrite=TRUE) We are now ready to run our SDMs, using the package biomod2.

Population-level evolutionary potential is best captured by genomic approaches, yet these data types mostly remain limited to model organisms. In contrast, traditional genetic data are broadly available. The relevance of genomic metrics, and how they differ from genetic metrics in the context of spatial conservation practices, remains unknown. This provides an opportunity to consider the relative contribution and impact of genomic compared to genetic metrics in their efficiency of selecting conservation areas of evolutionary importance. Here, we provide a guideline to include metrics of genetic and genomic variation into spatial planning analyses for multiple conservation objectives, and empirically explore how spatial prioritizations change when including different types of molecular information across multiple species. Specifically, we compare conservation solutions of scenarios including either an increase in molecular information (i.e. either a single locus; mtDNA, or several thousand loci; SNPs), or an increase in species included. We find that including less molecular information from many species leads to similar outcomes to including more molecular information from fewer species. Our work suggests that multi-species genetic data may be a cost- and time-effective surrogate for genomic data in spatial planning.","tags":[],"title":"A comparison of genetic and genomic approaches to represent evolutionary potential in conservation planning ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["ES Nielsen","R Henriques","M Beger","RJ Toonen","S von der Heyden"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577865600,"objectID":"bd2caad97bbbd5429e0a07140903da4b","permalink":"https://esnielsen.github.io/publication/bmc.eb.2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bmc.eb.2020/","section":"publication","summary":"As global change and anthropogenic pressures continue to increase, conservation and management increasingly needs to consider species’ potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, only S. granularis showed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation in C. punctatus and P. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts for S. granularis and P. angulosus, but not for C. punctatus. The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-model seascape genomics identifies distinct environmental drivers of selection among sympatric marine species","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"On Nov 4-7th 2019 I had the opportunity to attend The Conservation Symposium, which aims to bring together those working on conservation issues within South Africa.\nI enjoy this conference because it takes me out of my academia bubble and transports me into the ‘on the ground’ conservation practice realm. Students and academics make up a small portion of the attendees, outnumbered by NGOs, consulting companies, government organizations, attorneys, reporters, and filmmakers.\nThe main theme that struck me throughout this conference is the need to understand the human dimension to ensure effective conservation planning and management. Below I discuss a few of the key insights I had in relation to this topic.\n This year they had the first ever session dedicated to indigenous knowledge (IK) in conservation. It was interesting to see how as a country we are actually quite ahead of the game in the inclusion of IK in conservation publications. But the thing that irked me during this session was that the audience laughed at almost all mentions of local taboos (an example of which is that some indigenous people believe that touching a certain tree species causes women to immediately start menstruating). I think this demonstrates how far we have yet to go in reframing our mindsets to see conservation not from a typical westernized view, but from a more inclusive, open-minded framing.\n I also noted how all of the IK-related talks were in a terrestrial setting. I searched ‘South Africa indigenous knowledge marine’ in Web of Science and found zero papers investigating the use of IK in marine conservation. But, this made me remember an interesting poster at this year’s WIOMSA symposium where they interviewed local fishers along the South African coastline asking if water temperatures were changing, and reported areas where fishers’ knowledge differed from temperature changes monitored by scientists. We still have a long way to go with integrating IK into conservation management, and I think we will see a lot more marine conservation studies incorporating aspects of local communities in the near future.\n This year the symposium also introduced the Conservation Café, which involved youth-led discussions on conservation topics chosen by young (\u0026lt;35 yrs) attendants. During the tea breaks, we wrote on a white board what we wanted to discuss or added stars next to those topics on the board that we were interested in (seen in pictures below). In the session I went to, we talked again about IK within conservation, but also about capitalism and the goal of conservation. It was a lot of discussing problems, but one of the solutions I took away was that as youth we need to use our voices on social media, and also broaden our social circles in real life (or IRL as the kids say these days) to actively ‘market’ sustainable lifestyles and ‘make conservation cool again’.\n Lastly, there were some very interesting talks on how people perceive our parks within the country. Nyiko Mutileni gave a talk on her work where she interviewed local communities just a few km outside of Man’ombe Nature Reserve, asking if they have every entered the reserve, and if they benefit from the reserve. Many local people had never even heard of the park, only ~3% had entered the park, and most believed they did not benefit from the park because they could no longer access natural resources. Another talk by Dr Izak Smit described how he interviewed visitors of Kruger National Park to understand how they perceived conservation. Most visitors do not believe that conservation areas should be focused on making money, or that we humans should actively manage nature through ‘harsh’ management such as culling. But most surprising to me was almost half of the interviewees believe that humans are separate from nature rather than interconnected through ecological processes. Dr Smit mentioned how this is partly driven by the fact that while 1.9 million people visit Kruger annually, only ~1% actually get out of their cars, walk in the bush, and physically connect with nature. Our disconnect with the natural world is a major issue of our time (shown by the fact that I had to mention ‘in real life’ in the previous point), and protected areas will be fundamental to our individual and societal resilience as we face ever increasing uncertainties on this Earth.\n  ","date":1576333974,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576333974,"objectID":"349b2ccdbfcd467f6d9f1cca4d9203e6","permalink":"https://esnielsen.github.io/project/sccp_2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-14T16:32:54+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/sccp_2019/","section":"project","summary":"On Nov 4-7th 2019 I had the opportunity to attend The Conservation Symposium, which aims to bring together those working on conservation issues within South Africa.\nI enjoy this conference because it takes me out of my academia bubble and transports me into the ‘on the ground’ conservation practice realm.

Some of the highlights were:\n Prof Golden’s plenary which discussed the impacts of climate change on small-scale fisheries and human nutrition. Here we were shown which countries were most vulnerable to malnutrition due to declined marine catches, and also which fish species are ideal candidates for aquaculture within these countries based on their sustainability and nutritional value.\n Prof Dupont’s plenary which discussed the vast and complex implications of ocean acidification. Prof Dupont proved how science communication can make something intangible, such as ocean acidification, tangible, by offering shrimp tastings where people could actually taste the difference between seafood raised in normal or low pH conditions.\n The science communication mini-symposium, as well as the multiple videos that were shown during the conference (including the following: mzansi \u0026amp; kokoly)\n The Women In Science speed dating lunch where we discussed actions we could take to improve gender equality in the context of marine conservation within the region.

Ultimately, in order to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030, we will need large corporations and governments to take the lead to ensure that ongoing global development shifts from fossil fuels to renewable energy.\nBut while it is mainly a handful of companies that are responsible for 71% of greenhouse gas emissions, we as individuals and consumers can also fight towards and create a more sustainable future. As the lovel figure above by Ashley Lukashevsky shows, we are all in this together, and together we will rise.\nTherefore, this multi-media post is an ode to small, sustainable actions. And it is important that this is at no means and exhaustive list, and everyone has their own passions and actions that they are attracted to. In the end, the greatest thing we can do is start a conversation on sustainability, as this is the best way to discover new and exciting ways we can transform our society.\nFirst, here is a fun little song I wrote with the intention spreading the idea of sustainability in a way that is hopefully catchy and creative.\n  Probably one of the biggest ways to increase your impact in the fight against climate change is to speak up. Have conversations about climate change, and try to diversify your social circle to learn from those with different views on the climate crisis. You can also reach out to your local NGOs, send letters/emails to your elected officials, and question practices in your workplace.\nVote!\nI also find this nice resource which has several options to reduce your carbon footprint depending on the time, money, and effort you\u0026rsquo;re willing to spend.\nIn addition, indigenous people are arguably the leaders in protecting and conserving natural environments which are essential to absorb and retain carbon. Thus, you can support indigenous efforts, such as donating movements like LANDBACK.\nThen there is the TED talk which I found really interesting, and pointed out many \u0026lsquo;Sustainability Myths\u0026rsquo; that I was previously ignorant of.\nI was also recently ignorant of the CO2 emissions of the internet, until I stumbled upon this lovely infographic. You can also switch your browser from Google to Ecosia.\nThere are also many monetary ways to achieve a lower carbon footprint. One of my favorite new ways is with micro-funding. Find out how you can give micro-loans to green initiatives with Kiva.\nBut maybe these actions seem like they will take too much time and energy to implement. No need to fret, the UN has some actions even the laziest of us can do to become more sustainable: find them here.\nLastly, I would like to end with a quote by Anne Marie Bonneau said, \u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t need a handful of people doing zero waste perfectly.

What happened?\nIn theory, representation is still at the top of the international conservation agenda, it gets a solid mention in Aichi Target 11, which states:\n\u0026lsquo;By 2020, at least 17 percent of terrestrial and inland water areas and 10 percent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well-connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscape and seascape.\u0026rsquo;\nThe Nature Conservancy has championed the cause of representation, with representation and resilience forming the core principles of our new protect land and water strategy. But the rest of the world seems to have lost interest.\nIn my simple mind, The Nature Conservancy is the \u0026lsquo;habitat organisation.\u0026rsquo; That is why I joined. We focus on how to make more quality habitat, in all its forms, because it delivers benefits for people and nature. So it is only logical that we always return to a strong focus on habitat representation.\nYet while we continue to keep our eye on the ball, some organisations and groups believe that a focus on threatened species, via Key Biodiversity Areas, is the best way to prioritisation protection. Others are pushing connectivity as the most important conservation principle — let’s connect the Yukon to Yellowstone. I agree that both are important, but still very much secondary to the notion of protecting a representative sample of habitats or ecosystems.\nWhy are we losing this marketing campaign? In my opinion, representation is on the backburner because it is intellectually a little dull. Connectivity captures the imagination of many scientists, it can be measured by 100 different metrics, while ideas like \u0026lsquo;corridors\u0026rsquo; seem to capture the hearts and minds of the public and politicians. I love connectivity, but I am convinced it is a secondary issue. And, of course, threatened species are all so sexy — with their big brown eyes— much sexier than a place like the mallee woodland (my favourite habitat in Australia).\nSo here’s my challenge to you: Representation is the most boring but important concept in conservation. So how to we make it sexy again?\u0026rdquo;\n__\nI have been thinking of Prof Possingham\u0026rsquo;s question of how do we make the simple act of targeting representation sexy - and I think the answer comes down to making representation a surrogate for adaptability.\nI would argue that nothing is sexier in conservation science at the moment than prioritising areas that are more resilient to climate change. My work specifically looks at areas that are more genetically diverse, and thus assumed to be more resilient to environmental change. And interestingly, there have been several recent publications that suggest that by representing different habitat types (or different species distributions), you are also capturing genetic diversity.\nYou can find such papers in the links below:\n Geographical surrogates of genetic variation for selecting island populations for conservation\n Environmental and geographic variables are effective surrogates for genetic variation in conservation planning\n Incorporating evolutionary processes into conservation planning using species distribution data: a case study with the western Mediterranean herpetofauna: Evolutionary processes in conservation planning\n Testing large-scale conservation corridors designed for patterns and processes: comparative phylogeography of three tree species\n  But of course, this is science, so here is this paper arguing the opposite:\n On the validity of habitat as a predictor of genetic structure in aquatic systems: a comparative study using California water beetles  I think the argument of representative habitats as surrogates of species and genetic diversity could help bring this elegant practice back in the forefront of conservation planning, but I think it will also require scientists to change our perspective of our work, as to not think about how well our work will publish, but how well it can be applied to \u0026lsquo;real-world\u0026rsquo; conservation practice.\nSo really we need a whole paradigm shift within Academia\u0026hellip; but for now let\u0026rsquo;s just settle with a haiku about representation in conservation planning:\n~\nMPA designs,\nTo make easier target:\nRepresentation\n~\nThanks for reading!\n","date":1536330774,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536330774,"objectID":"6948b51fb1cb263b4b2ffc9ed99fb28b","permalink":"https://esnielsen.github.io/project/respresentation/","publishdate":"2018-09-07T16:32:54+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/respresentation/","section":"project","summary":"A case for habitat representation in 21st century conservation planning","tags":null,"title":"Representation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I have always loved Cindi Lauper\u0026rsquo;s style and her iconic song, \u0026lsquo;Girls just want to have fun\u0026rsquo;, and when I saw this photo (see above) from the Women\u0026rsquo;s March, I knew I needed to make my own rendition of the song.

However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.","tags":[],"title":"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Yet, there is no clear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despite multiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patterns differ between species, but the potential trade-offs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservation planning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metrics of genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypes and local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes ofconservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitat representation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representation than on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similar conservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diverse array of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital to creating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns.","tags":[],"title":"Multispecies genetic objectives in spatial conservation planning","type":"publication"}]
