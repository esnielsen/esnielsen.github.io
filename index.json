The sync file can also be converted into a genepop file for further analysis.\nNotes of Popoolation/Polpoolation2:\nThe sync2GenePop conversion step requires custom scripts to be written so that it can be run on all loci at once, instead of each locus individually. Feel free to contact me if you wish to see perl scripts used to create a GenePop file for an entire pool.\nFreeBayes -\ninput: BAM files \u0026amp; a reference fasta file\noutput: a pool VCF file\nCRISP -\ninput: BAM files, pool sample sizes, reference fasta file (NB: requires at least 2 pools/2 BAM files)\noutput: a pool VCF file\nSNVer -\ninput: BAM files \u0026amp; a text file with the BAM file names, number of haploids, number of samples, and filtering thresholds\noutput: a pool VCF file\nNotes on FreeBayes, CRISP \u0026amp; SNVer:\nEven though these programs make VCF files, I personally could not find a way to convert these VCF files to other formats such as genepop/genind/genlight with conversion tools such as PGDspider, vcf2genepop, or genomic_converter. However, it seems like it can be input into the R package poolfstat to calculate F-statistics, and be converted into files for BayPass and SelEstim.\nSNAPE-pool -\ninput: a samtools pileup file (not mpileup)\noutput: allele frequency output files\nnpstat -\ninput: a samtools mpileup file + individual BAM files (per pool).

However, most studies are carried out in regions with distinct environmental gradients or across large geographical areas, in which local adaptation is expected to occur. Therefore, the focus of this study is to characterize genomic variation and selective signals over short geographic areas within a largely homogeneous region. To assess adaptive signals between microhabitats within the rocky shore, we compared genomic variation between the Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), which is a low to mid-shore species, and the Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis), a high shore specialist. Using pooled restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, we described patterns of genomic variation and identified outlier loci in both species. We found relatively low numbers of outlier SNPs within each species, and identified outlier genes associated with different selective pressures than those previously identified in studies conducted over larger environmental gradients. The number of population-specific outlier loci differed between species, likely owing to differential selective pressures within the intertidal environment. Interestingly, the outlier loci were highly differentiated within the two northernmost populations for both species, suggesting that unique evolutionary forces are acting on marine invertebrates within this region. Our study provides a background for comparative genomic studies focused on non-model species, as well as a baseline for the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates along the South African west coast. We also discuss the caveats associated with Pool-seq and potential biases of sequencing coverage on downstream genomic metrics. The findings provide evidence of species-specific selective pressures within a homogeneous environment, and suggest that selective forces acting on small scales are just as crucial to acknowledge as those acting on larger scales. As a whole, our findings imply that future population genomic studies should expand from focusing on model organisms and/or studying heterogeneous regions to better understand the evolutionary processes shaping current and future biodiversity patterns, particularly when used in a comparative phylogeographic context.","tags":[],"title":"Complex signatures of genomic variation of two non-model marine species in a homogeneous environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Embed your slides or video here using shortcodes.

Yet, there is no clear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despite multiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patterns differ between species, but the potential trade-offs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservation planning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metrics of genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypes and local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes ofconservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitat representation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representation than on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similar conservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diverse array of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital to creating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns.","tags":[],"title":"Multispecies genetic objectives in spatial conservation planning","type":"publication"}]
