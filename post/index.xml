      <description>During July 1-5 2019, I attended the 11th Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) symposium at the University of Mauritius with two of my colleagues Nikki and Molly.
WIOMSA is always a great conference as it covers a variety of scientific disciplines and has a strong focus on integrating research and management within the region. Some of the highlights were:
 Prof Goldenâ€™s plenary which discussed the impacts of climate change on small-scale fisheries and human nutrition.</description>

      <description>Below is my entry to the Evolution Film Contest.
_
Every year our university opens its doors to high school students, so that they can get an idea of what postgraduates do within each lab. My intention with this video is to open our lab doors to a much wider audience and offer a view into my world as a PhD student studying conservation genetics. I wanted to make a video that is not only fun to watch, but also describes the basic theories and methodologies used within molecular ecology.</description>

      <description>Below is my entry to the Youth4Conservation video contest for the 2019 South African Conservation Symposium.
The Youth4Conservation movement partners young volunteers with local conservation organisations to help tackle critical conservation issues within South Africa.
This year, the Conservation Symposium partnered with WildTrust, offering discounted registration prices to young attendees who send a short video describing how they are contributing to conservation within South Africa.
With this video, I hope to share why genetics and genomics are important to conserving biodiversity, especially with regards to an uncertain climatic future.</description>

      <title>Pool-seq Programs for Population Genomics</title>

      <description>As Pooled sequencing gains popularity in the world of genomics, more and more programs are being introduced to specifically handle Pool-seq data. However, for students such as myself, it can be difficult to find the right program for each step of the bioinformatics process, and to know the correct data format and parameters used with each individual program.
Here is a short recap of the Pool-seq bioinformatic programs that I have gathered, including input and output files, and any additional notes I had on the program.</description>
