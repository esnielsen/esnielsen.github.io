      <description>This tutorial will go through how to run Species Distribution Models (SDMs) on coastal species using biomod2 in R.
We will obtain the predictor environmental variables from Bio-Oracle with the R package sdmpredictors. Since I work on intertidal species, I want to include both terrestrial and marine environmental variables. We will first load and stack the layers.
It is also important to only include variables that are available at both time points you want to model.</description>

      <description>As Pooled sequencing gains popularity in the world of genomics, more and more programs are being introduced to specifically handle Pool-seq data. However, for students such as myself, it can be difficult to find the right program for each step of the bioinformatics process, and to know the correct data format and parameters used with each individual program.
Here is a short recap of the Pool-seq bioinformatic programs that I have gathered, including input and output files, and any additional notes I had on the program.</description>
