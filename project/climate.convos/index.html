    <div class="article-style" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have spent a lot of time trying to reflect and reconnect. Many of us are having conversations with those we haven&rsquo;t spoken to in a while, and discussing topics we normally wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>As a self-proclaimed &lsquo;Climate Change Person&rsquo;, I am often looking to have conversations with regards to what I believe is the greatest threat our species and planet are facing (aka the climate crisis/6th mass extinction/human-induced snowballing interactions of doom). And even though we are currently in a pandemic worth talking about, I still find myself wanting to talk about COVID-19 and the chaos it has created in relation to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>That being said, I rarely find myself actually having climate conversations. And it seems like I am not alone. Only <a href="https://www.climaterealityproject.org/blog/take-number-harvey-edition-19-percent" target="_blank">19% of Americans</a> discuss the climate crisis least once a month. After seeing this, I asked myself &ldquo;WHY?&rdquo;. Then, I answered myself (I talk to myself a lot), &ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not like I can just bring it up easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We often think talking about the climate crisis has to be in a formal, direct, and emotionally heated manner. But it can start with a simple question. Below are some questions I came up to help myself jumpstart conversations, and hopefully they will reach and help some fellow climate conversationalist wanna-bes as well. Because in the words of Voltaire, &lsquo;Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Questions to lead into climate change discussion:</strong></p>

<p>What is your favorite plant/animal? Why? Have you seen it in the wild?</p>

<p>What is your favorite memory in nature?</p>

<p>Would you rather explore the deep ocean or the densest forests?</p>

<p>Do you think we should spend money on restoring Earth or colonizing new planets?</p>

<p>What is your favorite disaster movie? Do you think natural disasters are getting worse?</p>

<p>What do you think the benefits/dangers of current technology are? Do you think technology is helping or hurting our relationship with nature?</p>

<p>If you could make any change to the Earth, what would it be?</p>

<p>What do you think is the biggest problem we will face in the future? What do you think is the biggest problem we have faced in the past?</p>

<p>How far do you think the influences of your actions go?</p>

<p>Have you ever experienced fake news? What was it? How did you find out?</p>

<p>What are your hopes for your children?</p>

<p>What do you value most about nature?</p>

<p>What would you say your privileges are? How can you use them to help those that are under-privileged?</p>

<p>When was the last time you were influenced by something/someone?</p>

<p>Where do you get your information about the world?</p>

<p>What do you want your legacy to be?</p>

<p>What is your relationship with food?</p>

<p>What kind of traditions do you practice, and what role do they play in your life? Do you think traditions should adapt with new generations?</p>

<p>What freedoms are you thankful for?</p>

<p><strong>Questions once on the topic of climate change:</strong></p>

<p>Do you think humans have a moral responsibility to protect other living things?</p>

<p>How do you think we ended up in this climate crisis? What actions do you think led us here and why?</p>

<p>What is your relationship with nature/the climate? How do you think that relationship will look like in the future?</p>

<p>What are the things you think humanity is doing right?</p>

<p>Do you think we as humans are part of ecosystems? Or are we in control of them?</p>

<p>What is something you want to learn more about with regards to nature/climate?</p>

<p>What emotions come up when you think about our history/future on Earth?</p>

<p>What are some changes you want to make but are struggling to? What do you think are the biggest roadblocks to creating change?</p>

<p>Do you worry about climate change? Why/why not? Why do you think some people may think the opposite?</p>

<p>Do you feel guilty about doing anything which is bad for the environment? Have others made you feel guilty? Do you think you have made others feel guilty?</p>

<p>What actions should we take for a better future / to re-create how things were in the past?</p>

<p>What systems need to change the most to tackle the climate crisis?</p>

<p>What do you think your individual role is in taking action against the climate crisis? What sacrifices would you need to make to fulfill this role?</p>

<p>What are some changes you&rsquo;ve seen in your hometown with regards to the climate? Has it affected your life? Do you think it will in the future?</p>

<p>What jobs do you think are the most important now/will be the most important in the future?</p>

<p>What are actions you want to take to be more environmentally friendly?  Where did you learn about these? What are some you&rsquo;ve made in the past? What moved you to make them?</p>

<p>??????</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all I came up with for now! Feel free to add your own and share with the hashtag: #TalkClimate2Me</p>

<p>Happy discussing :)</p>
